This Repo contains the benchmarks we used to validate Natural Language Querying on BAI (Business Automation Insight) data.
Each benchmark consists of the following:
	a) An Ontology in .owl format as derived from the actual event logs as JSON documents.
        b) A set of natural language queries as tried by business users on this domain. We also provide a high level categorisation
           of the queries in terms of their complexity.
The references of the domains used are:
BPI Challenge 2017: We used the data released as part of BPI 2017 Challenge. It contains events pertaining to loan applications and offers created for these applications.
BPM service for workflow automation on case activities:  This is an IBM internal  BPM process deployed for IBM workflow automation to track case activities.
ODM service on loan validation: This BAI data set is generated from ODM decision running on Loan Validation. Data available at https://github.com/IBM-DBA/bai-ai-samples/tree/master/decisions/data.
